## Brief overview
Guidelines for systematic implementation logging and progress tracking after task completion. These rules ensure comprehensive documentation of development progress, technical decisions, and implementation details for the MIDI Visualizer project.

## Implementation log requirements
- Update the implementation log (.clinerules/log.md) after every task completion with detailed progress summary
- Include specific technical achievements, code changes, and verification results
- Document architectural decisions and deviations from planned structure
- Track completion percentages and phase progress against planned milestones
- Use consistent timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss timezone) for each log entry

## Progress tracking structure
- Maintain clear phase-based organization (Foundation, Recording, Triggers, Connections, etc.)
- Document component completion status with checkmarks and progress percentages
- Include both planned vs actual implementation comparisons
- Track architectural improvements and consolidations made during development
- Note verification steps and testing results for each completed feature

## Technical documentation standards
- Log specific console output and verification messages that confirm functionality
- Document MVC compliance and separation of concerns achievements
- Include details about visual constants consolidation and code organization
- Record integration challenges solved and technical solutions implemented
- Note performance considerations and optimization decisions made

## Verification and testing documentation
- Document step-by-step verification process for each completed feature
- Include browser testing results and console log confirmations
- Record interaction testing (mouse events, cursor changes, drag operations)
- Document edge cases tested and handled
- Include screenshots or visual confirmation when applicable

## Milestone tracking
- Update overall project completion percentages after each major task
- Document next priorities and pending work clearly
- Maintain architectural deviation tracking with justification for changes
- Record dependency relationships between components and phases
- Track both individual component completion and system integration progress
